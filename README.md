# todolist-js
Simple todolist in html-css-js   
**(CRUD - saving to localStorage)**  

Functionalities:  
- create task
- read task
- update task
- delete task

The tasks are stored in the local storage, so even if  
the user closes the browser, when opening it again the  
task is loaded (it remains saved)  

Removing the task from the list also removes it from localStorage
