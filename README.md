# TODO-List ðŸ“Œ
Simple todolist in html-css-js   
**(CRUD - saving to localStorage)**  

Functionalities:  
- create task
- read task
- update task
- delete task

The tasks are stored in the local storage, so even if  
the user closes the browser, when opening it again the  
task is loaded (it remains saved)  

Removing the task from the list also removes it from localStorage

-------------  

Create an http server so you can also use it on your phone  
In vscode - in the terminal, run -> http-server  
the server will be created and you can already use it following  
the created ip / port, as shown in the image below:
